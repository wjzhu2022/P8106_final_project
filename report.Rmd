## Introduction
The aim of this research is to develop a prediction model for recovery time from COVID-19 by merging three cohort studies that have been following participants for several years. Recovery information will be gathered through questionnaires and medical records, and personal characteristics data from before the pandemic will be utilized. The primary objective is to identify important risk factors for longer recovery time and gain a better understanding of the predictors of recovery time from COVID-19.
