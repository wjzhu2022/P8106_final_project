## Introduction
The aim of this research is to develop a prediction model for recovery time from COVID-19 by merging three cohort studies that have been following participants for several years. Recovery information will be gathered through questionnaires and medical records, and personal characteristics data from before the pandemic will be utilized. The primary objective is to identify important risk factors for longer recovery time and gain a better understanding of the predictors of recovery time from COVID-19.

## Data
This study employs the recovery.RData file, which comprises a dataset of 10,000 participants. The dataset contains a variable for recovery time from COVID-19 (in days), which is the focus of this research, along with 14 predictor variables, including demographic features, personal characteristics, vital measurements, and disease status. The predictors consist of both continuous and categorical variables. The study used two random samples of 2000 participants each, obtained from UNI wz2631 and another UNI jn2855 midterm project dataset, to create the dataset. The two datasets were merged, duplicates were removed, and the resulting combined dataset was partitioned into training and test datasets, with the training dataset containing 80% of the sample and the test dataset containing the remaining 20%. The partitioning was performed using the createDataPartition() function in R, with a seed value of 2023 to ensure reproducibility.


## Primary Analysis
To investigate patterns or relationships and better understand the multivariate dataset, lattice plots were generated using the featurePlot() function in the caret package. A total of 5 plots were created, one for each predictor variable in the dataset, in order to visualize the association between each predictor and the outcome variable of COVID-19 recovery time.
